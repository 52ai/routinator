//! Parsing of data in Basic Encoding Rules.
//!
//! While RFC 6488 demands that Signed Objects are always encoded using
//! Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER), the underlying Cryptographic Message
//! Syntax (CMS) defined by (currently) RFC 5652 allows Basic Encoding Rules
//! (BER), resulting in real ROAs that are encoded in the latter.
//! Consequently, we have to be able to decode both rules and this is what
//! this module does. Since DER is really just BER with a number of
//! limitiations, this is less of a problem then it may sound.
//!
//! Either rules are defined in ITU-T recommendation X.690. We only implement
//! a subset of the complete rules that is necessary for the task at hand.
//! To identify cases where that wasnâ€™t enough, this module has a special
//! error value `Error::Unimplemented`.
//!
//! Because all the data we encounter is small, we can operate on in-memory
//! data and use the `untrusted` crate for that.
