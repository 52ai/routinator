Trust Anchor Locators
=====================

This directory contains the trust anchor locators (TALs) of the five
Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) that are bundled with Routinator
and are necessary for RPKI validation.

Please be aware that you can only use the ARIN TAL (in file `arin.tal`)
if you agree to the [ARIN Relying Party Agreement (PDF)]. This TAL has been
included in Routinator with permission by ARIN provided we gain agreement
to the RPA before installation or use.
